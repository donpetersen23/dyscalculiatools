Bryant', 'Diane Pedrotty Bryant', 'Jennifer Porterfield', 'Minyi Shih Dennis', 'Terry Falcomata', 'Courtney Valentine', 'Chelsea Brewer', 'Kathy Bell']",2016,The Effects of a Tier 3 Intervention on the Mathematics Performance of Second Grade Students With Severe Mathematics Difficulties,"This study focuses on helping children with severe math difficulties, like dyscalculia, by improving their basic number skills and operations. The research shows that targeted, intensive teaching can boost their performance, which is beneficial for students, parents, and teachers looking for effective ways to support math learning.","Researchers aimed to see if a strong, focused math program could help second graders struggling badly with math. They worked with 12 students who had already tried other interventions without much success. The results showed that most students improved their math skills significantly, suggesting that this approach could be very helpful.","Parents and tutors can use structured, repetitive activities with visual aids like number lines or counting blocks to help reinforce basic math concepts and operations.",The study's small sample size and specific focus on second graders with severe difficulties limit how widely the results can be applied to other age groups or less severe cases.,bryant_2014.pdf

Bryant', 'Diane Pedrotty Bryant', 'Jennifer Porterfield', 'Minyi Shih Dennis', 'Terry Falcomata', 'Courtney Valentine', 'Chelsea Brewer', 'Kathy Bell']",2016,The Effects of a Tier 3 Intervention on the Mathematics Performance of Second Grade Students With Severe Mathematics Difficulties,"This research focuses on helping children with severe math difficulties, which often overlap with dyscalculia, by improving their understanding of number and operations concepts. The intensive intervention approach could help children with dyscalculia by providing them with targeted, systematic support to build foundational math skills. This can lead to better math performance and confidence for students, making learning less frustrating for them, their parents, and teachers.","The researchers wanted to see if an intensive, systematic intervention could help second-grade students with severe math difficulties improve their math skills. They worked with a group of students who had previously struggled with math, providing them with daily, focused lessons and games to reinforce learning. The results showed that most students significantly improved their math performance, which is important for their future success in math.","Parents and tutors can use systematic, explicit teaching methods and incorporate fun, repetitive games to help children practice and reinforce basic math concepts and skills.","The study involved a small number of participants and was conducted over a short period, which may limit the generalizability of the findings to broader populations and long-term effectiveness.",bryant_2014.pdf

Bryant', 'Diane Pedrotty Bryant', 'Jennifer Porterfield', 'Minyi Shih Dennis', 'Terry Falcomata', 'Courtney Valentine', 'Chelsea Brewer', 'Kathy Bell']",2016,The Effects of a Tier 3 Intervention on the Mathematics Performance of Second Grade Students With Severe Mathematics Difficulties,"This study addresses the specific math skills that children with dyscalculia struggle with, such as understanding number knowledge and rapid retrieval of basic facts. The research approach, using a systematic, explicit, and intensive intervention, could help these children by providing targeted support. The practical benefits include improved performance for students, better strategies for parents and tutors, and more effective teaching methods for educators.","The researchers wanted to see if a special, intensive intervention could improve the math skills of second-grade students who were struggling a lot with math. They tested this intervention on students who had already tried other methods but still weren't doing well. The results showed that most students improved significantly, which is important because it shows that targeted interventions can help students catch up.","Use systematic and explicit teaching methods, incorporate daily practice sessions, and reinforce learning with fun activities like games.","The study focused only on second-grade students, so the findings may not apply to other age groups. Also, the intervention was conducted in a specific setting, which might limit its generalizability.",bryant_2014.pdf

Bryant', 'Diane Pedrotty Bryant', 'Jennifer Porterfield', 'Minyi Shih Dennis', 'Terry Falcomata', 'Courtney Valentine', 'Chelsea Brewer', 'Kathy Bell']",2016,The Effects of a Tier 3 Intervention on the Mathematics Performance of Second Grade Students With Severe Mathematics Difficulties,"Children with dyscalculia often struggle with foundational math skills like basic number sense and rapid retrieval of basic facts. This research focuses on improving these very skills through an intensive intervention, which could help students with dyscalculia better grasp and retain mathematical concepts.","The researchers wanted to see if a more intensive math intervention could help second-grade students with severe math difficulties. They used a multiple-baseline design and found that the intervention significantly improved students' math performance, making them eligible to exit the intensive program.","Parents and tutors can use the intervention's intensive instructional design and weekly games to reinforce concepts directly with students, helping them improve their number sense and basic math skills.",The study's generalizability is limited because it focused on a specific group of students with severe difficulties and the intervention was conducted over a relatively short period.,bryant_2014.pdf

The intensive intervention approach shows that with systematic, explicit instruction and weekly games to reinforce concepts, children with severe math difficulties can improve enough to catch up to their peers.","Researchers wanted to see if an intensive math intervention could help second-grade students who were still struggling with basic math despite already receiving extra help. They worked with 12 students who scored very low on math tests, providing daily intensive math lessons for 9-10 weeks that included systematic instruction and weekly games. Most students improved significantly and scored well enough to no longer need the intensive intervention, showing that targeted, frequent instruction can help children with severe math difficulties catch up.","Parents and tutors can use systematic, explicit instruction for basic number concepts and math facts, incorporating weekly games that reinforce the skills being taught. Focus on foundational skills like number sense, counting strategies, and basic addition/subtraction with daily practice sessions using age-appropriate manipulatives and visual aids.","The study only included 12 second-grade students and lasted just 9-10 weeks, making it difficult to know if the results apply to other ages or if the improvements last over time. The research design doesn't include a control group for direct comparison, limiting confidence in attributing improvements solely to the intervention.",bryant_2014.pdf

The intensive, individualized intervention approach used could benefit children with dyscalculia by addressing their core difficulties with number sense and math fluency, setting them up for greater long-term success in math. The practical strategies and teaching methods discussed could provide helpful guidance for parents, tutors, and teachers working to support students with math learning differences.","The researchers wanted to find out if an intensive, one-on-one math intervention could improve the performance of second-grade students with severe math difficulties. The students participated in daily tutoring sessions focused on building their understanding of numbers and math operations. The results showed that most students made significant progress, performing at or above average levels by the end of the study, which could have important real-world benefits for their future math learning.","The intensive, personalized instruction approach used in this study, including frequent practice with math facts and concepts through engaging games and activities, could be effectively replicated in one-on-one tutoring sessions for students with dyscalculia or other math learning challenges.","The small sample size and focus on a specific grade level may limit the generalizability of the findings, and the study did not follow students long-term to assess the lasting impact of the intervention.",bryant_2014.pdf
