EBSCO_2025.pdf,The Development of Automatic Numerosity Processing in Preschoolers: Evidence for Numerosity–Perceptual Interference,Laurence Rousselle; Marie-Pascale Noël,2008,"This research examines the development of automatic processing of numerosity and perceptual information in preschoolers using a numerical Stroop paradigm. The results show that reciprocal influences between numerical and perceptual information exist from as early as age 3, and the sensitivity to irrelevant numerical cues tends to increase with age despite children's growing inhibition capacities. The study suggests that automatic numerosity processing starts to emerge earlier in development than previously thought."
ED_6041.pdf,Performance Differences on a Measure of Mathematics Vocabulary for English Learners and Non-English Learners With and Without Mathematics Difficulty,Sarah R. Powell; Katherine A. Berry; Le M. Tran,2020,"The study examined the mathematics vocabulary performance of 3rd grade students, including English Learners (ELs) and non-ELs with and without mathematics difficulty (MD). Results showed that ELs scored lower than non-ELs across all groups, and both ELs and non-ELs with equation and word-problem difficulty demonstrated lower performance on the mathematics vocabulary measure than students with only equation or word-problem difficulty. The findings indicate that ELs and students with MD have limited mathematics vocabulary knowledge and may require focused instruction on the language of mathematics."
EJ_1064.pdf,"Cognitive Strategies, Working Memory, and Growth in Word Problem Solving in Children With Math Difficulties",H. Lee Swanson; Catherine M. Lussier; Michael J. Orosco,2015,"This study investigated the role of strategy instruction and working memory capacity (WMC) on word problem solving accuracy in children with and without math difficulties (MD). The findings suggest that the availability of ample WM resources is an important precondition for strategy training to be successful for children with MD, as strategies are resource demanding and can easily overtax children with relatively smaller WMCs, leading to poorer learning outcomes. The study found that when WMC was set to a relatively high level, children with MD performed significantly better under visual-only strategy conditions, while children without MD performed better under verbal + visual conditions, compared to control conditions."

PMC_1250_7.pdf,Evaluating generative AI tools for visual communication design using the CoCoSo method under interval valued spherical fuzzy environment,Huiying Sun; Shunli Liu,2025,"This paper presents a robust multi-criteria decision-making (MCDM) approach to analyze the comparative efficiency of prevalent tools of generative AI based on the combined compromise solution (CoCoSo) approach in an interval-valued (IVSF) spherical fuzzy framework. The IVSF framework is used to reflect the differences in how much or how little an expert would like to assign a particular degree of membership, non-membership, or abstinence. The proposed IVSF-CoCoSo approach identifies DeepArt as the most relevant tool, as it achieves a higher rate of creativity improvement, yields the best results in terms of output quality, and offers customization. The study provides practical knowledge to designers, researchers, and other stakeholders who aim to implement generative AI in visual communication processes successfully."
PMC_1250_8.pdf,Toward a unified taxonomy of information dynamics via Integrated Information Decomposition,Pedro A. M. Mediano; Fernando E. Rosas; Andrea I. Luppi; Robin L. Carhart-Harris; Daniel Bor; Anil K. Seth; Adam B. Barrett,2025,"This paper introduces the Integrated Information Decomposition (ID) framework, which provides a comprehensive way to disentangle and characterize the information dynamics of complex multivariate systems. ID reveals previously unreported modes of collective information flow and allows expressing well-known measures of information transfer, information storage, and dynamical complexity as aggregates of these modes, overcoming known theoretical shortcomings. The framework is validated using computational models and examples from over 1,000 biological, social, physical, and synthetic dynamical systems, leading to a better understanding of dynamical complexity across disciplines."

The researchers found that the presence of MetS significantly increased the risk of suicide attempt, even in participants without traditional suicide risk factors. Genetic analyses also suggested a significant genetic correlation between MetS and suicide attempt. These findings highlight MetS as a potential objective indicator for monitoring suicide risk, and addressing MetS may offer an avenue for improved suicide management."

LUSSIER,2014,"This study investigated the role of strategy instruction on solution accuracy in children with and without serious math difficulties (MD) in problem solving. Children's posttest solution accuracy was compared on standardized and experimental measures as a function of strategy conditions. The study found that strategy conditions that combined verbal and visual strategies were most effective in improving problem-solving accuracy for children with MD, while the materials-only condition without explicit strategy instruction also led to improvements on experimental measures."
s_0010.pdf,Basic numerical skills in children with mathematics learning disabilities: A comparison of symbolic vs non-symbolic number magnitude processing,Laurence Rousselle; Marie-Pascale Noël,2007,This study compared the performance of children with mathematics learning disabilities (with and without comorbid reading disabilities) to normally achieving peers on tasks assessing basic numerical skills. The findings suggest that children with mathematics learning disabilities have difficulty in accessing number magnitude from symbols rather than in processing numerosity per se.
s_0022.pdf,Magnitude comparison in preschoolers: What counts? Influence of perceptual variables,Laurence Rousselle; Emmanuelle Palmers; Marie-Pascale Noël,2004,"This study examined numerosity comparison in 3-year-old children. The results showed no evidence that preschoolers use an analog number magnitude or an object-file mechanism to compare numerosities. Rather, their inability to compare sets controlled for surface area suggests that they rely on perceptual cues. Furthermore, the development of numerosity-based representations seems to be related to some understanding of the cardinality concept."
