    "summary": "This research examines the development of automatic processing of numerosity and perceptual information in preschoolers using a numerical Stroop paradigm. The results show that reciprocal influences between numerical and perceptual information exist from as early as age 3, and the sensitivity to irrelevant numerical cues tends to increase with age despite children's growing inhibition capacities. The study suggests that automatic numerosity processing starts to emerge earlier in development than previously thought.",

Results showed that ELs scored lower than non-ELs across all groups, and both ELs and non-ELs with equation and word-problem difficulty demonstrated lower performance on the mathematics vocabulary measure than students with only equation or word-problem difficulty. The findings indicate that ELs and students with MD have limited mathematics vocabulary knowledge and may require focused instruction on the language of mathematics.",

The findings suggest that the availability of ample WM resources is an important precondition for strategy training to be successful for children with MD, as strategies are resource demanding and can easily overtax children with relatively smaller WMCs, leading to poorer learning outcomes. The study found that when WMC was set to a relatively high level, children with MD performed significantly better under visual-only strategy conditions, while children without MD performed better under verbal + visual conditions, compared to control conditions.",

The results showed that around 1.31% of the effects of childhood disadvantage on later-life GCA were mediated by cortical SA profile, suggesting that childhood disadvantage may contribute to later-life GCA differences partly by influencing the spatial patterning of cortical SA in a way that deviates from the normative cortical organizational principle.",

Verbal working memory, processing speed, and working memory factors were identified as potential shared risk factors for ADHD and arithmetic ability, while cognitive flexibility and inhibition were found to have specific contributions to arithmetic ability.

    "summary": "This study used high-field fMRI at 7 Tesla to investigate how the developing human brain represents numerosity. The researchers found that children aged 11-12 years already exhibit logarithmic Gaussian tuning and topographically organized responses to adjacent numerosities, similar to what has been observed in adults. Remarkably, the tuning models explained comparable amounts of variance in children and adults, indicating that the precision of number representation is already quite advanced in the developing brain.",

    "summary": "This study used diffusion kurtosis imaging (DKI) to assess microstructural abnormalities in both gray matter and white matter of patients with minimal hepatic encephalopathy (MHE). The results showed that MHE patients had decreased fractional anisotropy in the temporal part of the left superior longitudinal fasciculus and decreased kurtosis fractional anisotropy in the left corticospinal tract and anterior thalamic radiation, which correlated with worse neurocognitive test scores. MHE patients also exhibited increased volume of the thalamus. These findings suggest that disruption of microstructural integrity may underlie the pathophysiological underpinnings of neurocognitive dysfunction in MHE.",

The results showed that better online SL performance was associated with larger N400 amplitudes across different levels of cloze probability. Working memory also interacted with SL in modulating N400 amplitude. These findings suggest that individual differences in SL abilities contribute to variability in the N400 response, supporting the view that semantic operations reflected by the N400 may involve statistical learning processes.",

The findings reveal that math and reading trajectories of children with learning disabilities parallel those of children without disabilities, with skill growth slowing over time. The impairment levels and growth trajectories of children with co-occurring disabilities match the within-domain patterns of children with isolated disabilities, supporting an additive model of co-occurrence. Math disability is domain-specific and becomes more pronounced over time, while reading disability impacts both domains early and maintains curriculum-contingent math deficits.",

The CFN tutoring was associated with significant improvements in numerical and arithmetic fluency. Neural representational similarity (NRS) analysis revealed that deficient cross-format NRS in children with MD was normalized following tutoring, aligning with pre-tutoring levels of typically-developing (TD) peers. This normalization was most pronounced in parietal and parahippocampal regions known to support quantity and spatial representation. The study suggests that developmentally tailored interventions can support children with MD through targeted, evidence-based strategies.",

    "summary": "This work proposes two benchmark tasks inspired by cognitive science to evaluate the visual enumeration capabilities of multimodal foundation models. The authors analyze popular visual question answering, image-to-text, and text-to-image AI systems and find that even the most advanced models cannot reliably name the number of objects in simple visual stimuli or generate images containing a target number of items, especially for numbers outside the subitizing range. The results demonstrate that developing an intuitive visual understanding of number remains challenging for AI models and that merely increasing model size might not be a viable strategy to promote the emergence of systematic counting skills.",

The results indicate that healthcare websites have better accessibility compared to incubation websites, though both need to address certain critical issues to achieve excellent accessibility. The proposed model can aggregate diverse user and expert responses to contribute to more inclusive digital environments and provide more accurate and context-sensitive accessibility evaluation.",

The analysis identifies four defining attributes: loss of autonomy, erosion of identity and self-image, biographical rupture, and negative coping. Antecedents include physiological aging, chronic degenerative disease, cognitive decline, and psychosocial/cultural factors that constrain autonomy. Consequences extend beyond functional limitations, affecting emotional well-being and generating ethical and context-specific decisions. The proposed conceptual framework offers practical guidance for applying a transpersonal approach, prioritizing mutual presence, active listening, cultural attunement, and shared decision-making to preserve dignity, meaning, and connection in daily care.",

    "summary": "The study examines whether EEG frequency bands targeted by neurofeedback change spontaneously over time, are influenced by a continuously modified visual stimulus, and are affected by the frequency of stimulus modification. The results reveal a spontaneous increase in alpha power, an increase in theta power when exposed to a continuously modified visual stimulus, and an absence of changes in the studied EEG frequency bands when manipulating the stimulus modification frequency. These findings suggest that EEG changes observed during neurofeedback may be influenced by the task environment itself, rather than solely by successful EEG self-modulation.",

When evaluating factors that facilitated positive participation experiences, parents of children with DLD provided ratings mostly comparable to those of TLD parents.

    "summary": "This article reviews and classifies dementia risk assessment tools to inform dementia risk reduction. It synthesizes knowledge on risk scores for all-cause dementia, Alzheimer's disease, and vascular dementia, evaluates their content, cost, validation, and suitability for implementing risk reduction guidelines. The authors conclude that there are methodological limitations in the field, but several validated risk scores for all-cause dementia and Alzheimer's disease are now available that assess modifiable factors and offer cost-effective dementia risk assessment and risk reduction advice.",

    "summary": "The research developed a computational model using Fuzzy Cognitive Maps (FCMs) to simulate and predict individual pain experiences, based on expert input across multiple disciplines. The model integrates six significant concepts that influence pain perception: brain and neural basis of pain, psychological factors, social factors, individual differences, type of tissue damage, and general pain perception. The model structure indicates strong reinforcing influences between psychological and neural factors, while social influences tend to inhibit perceived pain. The findings suggest that the FCM model provides a useful framework for representing interactions between pain and its influencing factors.",

The researchers analyzed a sample of 1,015 children using a data-driven subtyping approach and found that dyscalculia subtypes and children with dyscalculia in general do not seem to be clearly distinguishable from children without dyscalculia, as the boundaries are fluid. This suggests that all children who have difficulties in mathematics should be supported, and not only those classified as dyscalculic.",

The review found that acupuncture, including manual acupuncture and electroacupuncture, consistently demonstrated positive effects on PSCI, with changes in brain regions and networks involved in cognition. The therapeutic effects of acupuncture on PSCI appear to be mediated through the regulation of cognition-related brain networks, though further research using multiple imaging techniques and large-scale clinical trials is needed to validate the findings.",

The framework develops a comprehensive criteria system, uses rough numbers to represent linguistic judgments, determines robust criteria weights via the rough BWM, and ranks hospital alternatives by considering overall and criterion-level performance through the rough GLDS method. The proposed approach is validated through a case study and shown to produce reliable and interpretable rankings, identify the best-performing hospital, and demonstrate robustness under sensitivity analysis.",

    "summary": "This study aimed to systematically review and meta-analyze the effects of very-low-calorie ketogenic diets (VLCKD) on gut microbiota in individuals with obesity. The meta-analysis revealed that VLCKD interventions significantly improved gut microbial α-diversity, increased the abundance of Akkermansia, and increased the Firmicutes-to-Bacteroidetes ratio, while reducing the abundance of Bifidobacterium. Subgroup analyses further explored the effects based on BMI, age, and intervention duration. The study concludes that VLCKD is a promising dietary intervention for modulating gut microbiota in individuals with obesity, but its bidirectional effects warrant caution.",

The results showed no evidence that preschoolers use an analog number magnitude or an object-file mechanism to compare numerosities. Rather, their inability to compare sets controlled for surface area suggests that they rely on perceptual cues. Furthermore, the development of numerosity-based representations seems to be related to some understanding of the cardinality concept.",
