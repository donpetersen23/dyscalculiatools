        "summary": "This study investigated the effectiveness of a systematic, explicit, and intensive Tier 3 intervention on the mathematics performance of second-grade students with severe mathematics difficulties. The researchers used a multiple-baseline design across groups of participants and found that the intervention, which included more intensive instructional features than a previous Tier 2 intervention, led to significantly improved performance in number and operations concepts and procedures, which are foundational for later mathematics success. The study shows that for students who continue to struggle despite Tier 1 and Tier 2 interventions, a more intensive Tier 3 intervention can be effective in improving their mathematics skills.",

The study focuses on students with severe mathematics difficulties, which is a key characteristic of dyscalculia. The findings suggest that an intensive, targeted Tier 3 intervention can be effective in improving the foundational mathematical skills, such as numerical knowledge and basic fact retrieval, that are often impaired in individuals with dyscalculia. The insights from this study can inform the development of specialized interventions and instructional approaches to better support students with dyscalculia in developing the necessary mathematical competencies for academic success.",

        "summary": "This study examined the development of automatic processing of numerosity and perceptual information in preschoolers. Using a nonsymbolic numerical Stroop paradigm, the researchers tested 3- to 6-year-olds' abilities to compare the numerosity or total filled areas of collections of dots or bars that varied along both dimensions. The results demonstrated the existence of reciprocal influences between numerical and perceptual information beginning at age 3, with the irrelevant perceptual influences remaining stable throughout development, while the sensitivity to irrelevant numerical cues tended to increase with age despite children's growing inhibition capacities. The study found no significant correlation between these developmental changes and the acquisition of counting knowledge.",

The insights from this study could inform the development of targeted interventions and educational strategies to support the development of number sense and automatic numerosity processing in children with dyscalculia.",

        "summary": "This study investigated the mathematics vocabulary performance of 3rd grade English Learners (ELs) and non-ELs with and without mathematics difficulty (MD). Using screening data, the researchers categorized students into four groups based on equation solving and word problem performance: no MD, equation difficulty, word problem difficulty, or equation and word problem difficulty. They found that ELs scored lower than non-ELs across all groups, and both ELs and non-ELs with equation and word problem difficulty demonstrated lower performance on the mathematics vocabulary measure than students with only equation or word problem difficulty. The findings indicate that ELs and students with MD have limited mathematics vocabulary knowledge and may require focused instruction on the language of mathematics.",
        "dyscalculia_relevance": "This research directly addresses the challenges faced by students with dyscalculia (a specific learning disability in mathematics) in acquiring mathematics vocabulary. The study shows that students with difficulties in both equation solving and word problem solving, who likely include many students with dyscalculia, have the poorest mathematics vocabulary knowledge. This suggests that targeted instruction in mathematics vocabulary may be particularly important for supporting the learning of students with dyscalculia. The insights from this study can help inform evidence-based practices for educators and therapists working to address the language-related difficulties experienced by individuals with dyscalculia.",

Children in Grades 2 and 3 were randomly assigned to one of four treatment conditions: verbal-only strategies, verbal + visual strategies, visual-only strategies, or an untreated control. The results showed that treatment effects were significantly moderated by WMC, with better outcomes when WMC was set to a high rather than low level. Children with MD performed significantly better under visual-only strategy conditions, while children without MD performed better under verbal + visual conditions, compared to control.",

The study demonstrates that the effectiveness of cognitive strategy instruction for improving word problem solving skills is heavily dependent on a child's working memory capacity. For children with math difficulties, including those with dyscalculia, working memory limitations can constrain their ability to benefit from certain types of strategy training. The findings suggest that educators and therapists should carefully consider a student's working memory skills when designing intervention approaches, and may need to tailor strategies to match the individual's cognitive profile.",

The researchers stratified students based on MD status (MD alone vs. MD with reading difficulty) and location (proximal vs. distal to the intervention developer), then randomly assigned them to a control group or one of two NC remediation conditions. Both remediation conditions were embedded in a validated word-problem tutoring protocol. The researchers found that strategic counting without deliberate practice led to superior NC fluency compared to the control group, but strategic counting with deliberate practice resulted in the best NC fluency and transfer to procedural calculations compared to the other conditions. The study also replicated the efficacy of the Pirate Math word-problem tutoring program.",

The researchers conducted a dyadic social judgement task with friends and strangers, where targets received social evaluative feedback and empathizers observed the scenario. The results showed that friends exhibited greater affect sharing than strangers when witnessing their partners being accepted or rejected, supported by more pronounced event-related potential similarity and greater interbrain neural synchronization between the empathizer's left prefrontal cortex and the target's left temporoparietal junction. These findings highlight the sensitivity of empathy to interpersonal closeness, which links to sustained attention, detailed evaluation, and functional communication between brain regions for mentalizing and emotional regulation.

The researchers compared these markers between 90 children diagnosed with SLD and 90 healthy controls. They found that the SLD group had significantly higher levels of these inflammatory markers and lower lymphocyte counts. Multivariate analysis indicated that the systemic inflammation index was the only parameter independently associated with an SLD diagnosis. The findings suggest that inflammation may play a role in the etiopathogenesis of SLD, and these markers could be potential biomarkers for early diagnosis. Further research may lead to anti-inflammatory therapies for SLD.",

The study's finding that inflammatory markers like the systemic inflammation index are elevated in children with SLD, which often includes dyscalculia, provides important insights. It suggests that inflammation may be a contributing factor to the development of dyscalculia and other math learning difficulties. This knowledge could inform the development of early diagnostic tools and anti-inflammatory interventions to support individuals with dyscalculia.",

        "summary": "This study investigated how the spatial patterning of cortical surface area (SA), referred to as cortical SA profile, mediates the effects of childhood disadvantage on later-life general cognitive ability (GCA). Using MRI data from 477 adults aged 56-72, the researchers found that around 1.31% of the effects of childhood disadvantage on later-life GCA were mediated by cortical SA profile. Specifically, higher childhood disadvantage was associated with greater deviation of the cortical SA spatial patterning from the normative unimodal-transmodal organization, which in turn was linked to lower later-life GCA. These findings suggest that childhood disadvantage may contribute to later-life cognitive differences by influencing the spatial organization of the cortex during critical periods of brain development.",
        "dyscalculia_relevance": "This research is relevant to understanding dyscalculia, or math learning difficulties, because it suggests that early-life disadvantages can have lasting impacts on the spatial organization of the cortex, which in turn is associated with general cognitive abilities like reasoning and problem solving. Since dyscalculia is characterized by deficits in basic numerical and mathematical skills, this study provides insight into how disruptions to normative brain development from childhood disadvantage may contribute to the emergence of math learning difficulties. The findings also indicate potential neuroanatomical targets for interventions and supports aimed at mitigating the cognitive impacts of childhood disadvantage, which could benefit individuals with dyscalculia.",

The researchers conducted a between-group comparison on both performance-based and scale-based executive function, controlling for age, Raven score, and gender. They then used partial correlation analysis and regression analysis to investigate the association between executive function, ADHD symptoms, and arithmetic ability. The results showed that both ADHD groups had more severe executive function impairment than the control group, and the ADHD+DD group performed worse in performance-based executive functions but similar in scale-based executive functions compared to the ADHD-DD group. Verbal working memory, processing speed, and scale-based working memory factors were found to be potential shared risk factors for ADHD and arithmetic ability, while cognitive flexibility and inhibition contributed uniquely to arithmetic ability. Processing speed and inhibition were identified as potential etiological elements for distinguishing ADHD-DD and ADHD+DD.",

The researchers used tract-based spatial statistics and voxel-based morphometry to assess white matter and gray matter changes, respectively, and examined associations with neurocognitive performance. They found that MHE patients showed decreased white matter integrity in regions involved in cognitive, attention, and motor functions, which correlated with worse test scores. MHE patients also exhibited increased gray matter volume in the thalamus. These findings suggest that disruption of brain microstructural integrity may underlie the neurocognitive dysfunction seen in MHE, providing neuroimaging evidence for the disease mechanisms.",

        "summary": "This study investigated the relationship between individual differences in statistical learning (SL) abilities and event-related potential (ERP) responses during language processing. The researchers tested participants' SL performance using speech segmentation and artificial grammar learning tasks, and then recorded their N400 responses to sentences varying in cloze probability (high, intermediate, low). The results showed that better online SL performance was associated with larger N400 amplitudes across conditions. Working memory also had a significant main effect and interacted with SL in modulating N400 amplitude, while cloze probability had an independent effect. These findings suggest that individual differences in SL abilities contribute to variability in N400 responses, supporting the idea that the semantic operations reflected by the N400 may involve statistical learning processes.",

        "summary": "This study investigated the genetic basis of congenital anomalies of the kidneys and urinary tract (CAKUT), a common cause of pediatric kidney disease. The researchers performed exome sequencing and genetic analysis on a large cohort of CAKUT patients and identified diagnostic or candidate diagnostic variants in 14.1% of cases. They found a significant enrichment of rare, damaging variants in genes expressed during kidney development and associated with other developmental disorders, suggesting shared genetic mechanisms. Consistent with this, 18% of CAKUT patients with diagnostic variants also had neurodevelopmental or cardiac phenotypes. The study identified 40 candidate CAKUT genes, two of which (ARID3A and NR6A1) were confirmed as causal. Overall, the findings indicate that many unidentified developmental disorder syndromes may be discovered through larger cohort studies and cross-phenotype analysis, leading to a better understanding of the genetic and phenotypic spectrum of these conditions.",
        "dyscalculia_relevance": "This research is relevant to dyscalculia and math learning difficulties in a few key ways. First, it demonstrates the potential for shared genetic mechanisms underlying different developmental disorders, including both kidney and neurological/cognitive conditions. This suggests that some cases of dyscalculia may be linked to the same genetic factors that contribute to other developmental problems, such as congenital kidney anomalies. Additionally, the study highlights the importance of taking a holistic, cross-phenotype approach to identifying causal genes and understanding the range of symptoms associated with particular genetic variants. This insight could inform efforts to better characterize the subtypes and underlying etiologies of dyscalculia, which is a complex and heterogeneous condition. Finally, the identification of specific candidate genes like ARID3A and NR6A1 provides potential targets for future research and potential therapeutic interventions relevant to dyscalculia and other math learning difficulties.",

Using a sample of 498 children followed for 5 years, the researchers found that the math and reading trajectories of children with learning disabilities parallel those of children without disabilities, with skill growth slowing over time regardless of skill level. The impairment levels and growth trajectories of children with co-occurring disabilities matched the within-domain patterns of children with isolated disabilities, supporting an additive model of co-occurrence. The study also found that math disability impairments are domain-specific and become more pronounced over time, while reading disability impairments impact both domains early on, become more domain-specific over time, but maintain curriculum-contingent math deficits.",

The researchers conducted a 2x2 factorial experiment using an online learning system, examining the effects of pedagogical agent presence/absence and emotional feedback presence/absence on student motivation, experience, and achievement. The results showed that pedagogical agents had a slightly negative influence on transfer scores, while emotional feedback significantly boosted student engagement. When both were combined, students exhibited the highest motivation, though this did not significantly enhance emotional perception or performance and slightly reduced transfer scores. Notably, the use of these tools shortened learning duration. The findings suggest that educators should exercise caution when designing pedagogical agents in online formative assessments to avoid potential distractions, while the integration of emotional feedback can contribute to a more humanized digital learning environment.",

The tutoring program was associated with significant improvements in numerical and arithmetic fluency. Neural representational similarity (NRS) analysis revealed that the deficient cross-format NRS in children with MD was normalized following tutoring, aligning with pre-tutoring levels of typically-developing (TD) peers. This normalization was most pronounced in parietal and parahippocampal regions known to support quantity and spatial representation. The study observed a distinctive pattern of neural plasticity across groups, with children with MD showing increased cross-format NRS following tutoring and TD children showing a decrease, suggesting a nonlinear, skill-dependent plasticity.",

It assessed the methodological quality and risk of bias in the available evidence. The review found 11 studies (representing 10 independent experiments) with 3033 participants, focusing mainly on dyslexia and other specific learning disorders. Personalized/adaptive learning systems and game-based learning were the most common AI interventions. All 11 studies reported positive outcomes, but the risk of bias assessment revealed significant methodological limitations, with no studies having a low risk of bias. Despite these limitations, quantitative results from the stronger studies showed large effect sizes in areas like arithmetic fluency and reading comprehension. The review concludes that AI-based interventions demonstrate significant potential for supporting students with learning disabilities, but the current evidence base is limited and potentially biased, warranting cautious interpretation.",

        "summary": "This study investigated sex differences in stroke risk factors and mechanisms in a multi-ethnic Asian population. Data were collected on 1165 patients admitted to Raffles Hospital for stroke. The results showed that compared to males, females had older age and higher rates of diabetes mellitus, but lower rates of smoking, prior cerebrovascular events, and hemorrhagic stroke. There were no differences in the mechanisms of hemorrhagic or ischemic stroke between sexes. The study also found sex-ethnic differences, with more Chinese and fewer Indians among female stroke patients compared to males. The findings corroborate previous studies on sex differences in stroke, and the novel insight on sex-ethnic differences provides important context for understanding stroke in diverse Asian populations.",
        "dyscalculia_relevance": "This research does not directly address dyscalculia or math learning difficulties. However, the sex differences identified in stroke risk factors, such as higher rates of diabetes mellitus in female stroke patients, could have implications for understanding how sex-specific factors may contribute to math learning challenges. Further research would be needed to explore any potential connections between the sex-based stroke risk factors observed in this study and the development of dyscalculia or other math-related learning disabilities.",

        "summary": "This study aimed to estimate a Minimum Clinically Important Difference (MCID) for the Developmental Behaviour Checklist, parent-report (DBC-P), which measures behavioral and emotional problems in children and adolescents with intellectual disabilities. The researchers used both distribution-based methods, through meta-analysis of intervention studies using the DBC-P, and anchor-based methods, through consultation with parents and professionals. The results suggest an MCID range of 3-9 points on the DBC-P total raw score, which can help contextualize the meaningfulness of changes in this outcome measure for evaluating interventions. The findings provide a useful standard for interpreting the clinical significance of DBC-P score changes in research and practice.",

The researchers analyzed three complementary fMRI metrics - fractional amplitude of low-frequency fluctuations (fALFF), regional homogeneity (ReHo), and voxel-mirrored homotopic connectivity (VMHC) - to comprehensively characterize typical brain maturation across youth. The results revealed a general pattern of declining local and interhemispheric connectivity with increasing age, indicating increasing functional integration and network specialization from late childhood through adolescence. These findings provide a valuable benchmark for identifying developmental deviations in clinical populations.",

The functional brain metrics examined, such as local connectivity and interhemispheric coordination, have been linked to math abilities in prior studies of dyscalculia. The observed age-related decreases in these measures of brain function likely reflect the typical neurodevelopmental processes that support the development of mathematical skills. By establishing a normative developmental trajectory, this study offers important insights that can inform the identification and support of individuals with atypical brain development related to dyscalculia.",

The researchers presented a case of a patient with a family history of early-onset Alzheimer's disease (EOAD) and cerebral amyloid angiopathy (CAA) who developed SP. They also reviewed previously published cases with similar presentations related to PSEN1 mutations. The key findings were that PSEN1 mutations can be associated with SP, often accompanied by cognitive decline and the presence of cotton wool plaques. A positive family history of either motor or cognitive symptoms was consistently observed. The study emphasizes the importance of considering PSEN1 mutations in the differential diagnosis of patients presenting with SP, especially in the presence of cognitive symptoms, CAA, or a family history of Alzheimer's disease.",

        "summary": "This study investigates the visual enumeration capabilities of state-of-the-art multimodal AI systems, including popular visual question answering models and advanced image-to-text and text-to-image AI models. The researchers propose two benchmark tasks inspired by cognitive science - numerosity naming and numerosity production - to objectively evaluate the models' number sense and counting abilities. Their analyses show that even the most advanced models struggle to reliably name the number of objects in simple visual stimuli or generate images containing a target number of items. Especially for numbers outside the subitizing range (up to 4), the models' responses are often far from the target numerosity, and their error patterns differ from the consistent, abstract number sense observed in humans. The findings demonstrate that developing an intuitive visual understanding of number remains challenging for AI models, and that merely increasing model size may not be a viable strategy to promote the emergence of systematic counting skills.",
        "dyscalculia_relevance": "This research is highly relevant to understanding dyscalculia and supporting individuals with math learning difficulties. The benchmark tasks used in the study directly assess core numerical skills, such as exact enumeration and approximate number sense, which are known to be impaired in dyscalculia. The researchers' observations that even state-of-the-art AI models fail to exhibit the consistent, abstract number representations and systematic counting abilities seen in typical human development provide valuable insights into the cognitive and neural mechanisms underlying dyscalculia. The findings suggest that simply scaling up the models may not be enough to replicate the robust number sense and counting skills that most people develop. This underscores the need for more targeted approaches to support the acquisition of numerical competencies in individuals with dyscalculia, potentially involving specialized training or the use of multimodal learning strategies.",

Using functional near-infrared spectroscopy (fNIRS), the researchers examined whether specialized language regions exist from early life or emerge gradually through development. They first validated an individual functional channel of interest (fCOI) approach to dissociate language and cognitive control regions in adults, and then applied this method to toddlers aged 2-4 years. The results showed that both adults and toddlers exhibited language selectivity in the left inferior frontal gyrus (LIFG), with stronger responses to intact versus degraded speech, regardless of cognitive demands. In contrast, language selectivity in the right inferior frontal gyrus (RIFG) was only present in adults, suggesting that the organization of language-related regions continues to develop over time. The study provides evidence for early neural specialization of language processing in the LIFG, while highlighting the protracted development of language organization.",

The researchers conducted meta-analyses across multiple independent datasets, examining both behavioral and genetic associations. The findings indicate that impairments in non-linguistic rhythm skills, such as beat synchronization and rhythm discrimination, are a modest but consistent risk factor for developmental speech, language, and reading disorders. Further, cross-trait polygenic score analyses revealed shared genetic architecture between musical rhythm and reading abilities, suggesting genetic pleiotropy between musicality and language-related phenotypes. These results provide important insights into the biological and clinical links between rhythm processing and communication-related difficulties, with potential implications for early identification and targeted interventions.",

        "summary": "This study investigated the development of four cognitive areas (verbal comprehension, perceptual reasoning, working memory, and processing speed) and the Full Scale Intellectual Quotient (FSIQ) among students in a vocational training program for outdoor activity guidance in Spain. The researchers administered the WAIS-IV test to 176 students aged 16-29. The results showed that students generally scored below the population mean in overall IQ, with significant variability. Perceptual reasoning and working memory were average for most students, while verbal comprehension scores were predominantly low, and processing speed scores were very low. The study highlights the challenges faced by vocational students, particularly in areas critical for learning, and emphasizes the need for tailored educational support to enhance cognitive performance and success in vocational education pathways.",
        "dyscalculia_relevance": "This research provides insights into the cognitive profiles of students in a vocational training program, which can have relevance for understanding and supporting individuals with dyscalculia or other math learning difficulties. The finding that students showed particularly low scores in processing speed, a key component of numeracy skills, suggests that these students may be more susceptible to dyscalculia or math-related challenges. The study underscores the importance of tailoring educational interventions to address the specific cognitive strengths and weaknesses of vocational students, which could also benefit those with dyscalculia by targeting their areas of difficulty and building on their strengths.",

The researchers used the Cognitive Assessment System (CAS) to evaluate cognitive processing and the Movement Assessment Battery for Children—Second Edition (MABC-2) to assess motor skills. The results showed significant performance disparities between DCD and typically developing children across attentional and planning domains, with notable cognitive-motor correlations. Discriminant function analyses revealed high classification accuracy, highlighting the diagnostic value of targeted cognitive indices. Notably, about one-third of the children with DCD exhibited deficits in one or more cognitive domains. The findings emphasize the importance of neuropsychological profiling in understanding DCD and suggest that targeted motor interventions may simultaneously enhance executive function.",

The researchers collected data from 401 workers at an aluminum plant, measuring plasma aluminum concentration, cognitive function using the Montreal Cognitive Assessment, and various blood indicators. The results showed a dose-response relationship between aluminum exposure and decreased cognitive function, with HRR partially mediating this effect. The study suggests that occupational aluminum exposure negatively impacts workers' cognitive function and HRR levels, and that HRR can partially explain the effects of aluminum exposure on cognitive function.",

        "summary": "This study introduced DiabetesXpertNet, a novel deep learning framework designed to enhance the prediction of Type 2 diabetes mellitus. The model incorporates a convolutional neural network architecture with dynamic channel attention modules to prioritize clinically significant features and a context-aware feature enhancer to capture complex sequential relationships within structured datasets. The study evaluated DiabetesXpertNet on two diabetes datasets and found that it outperformed existing machine learning and deep learning models, achieving high accuracy, AUC, precision, recall, and F1-score. The results demonstrate the robustness and interpretability of DiabetesXpertNet, making it a promising tool for early Type 2 diabetes diagnosis in clinical settings.",
        "dyscalculia_relevance": "While this research focused on predicting Type 2 diabetes rather than dyscalculia or math learning difficulties, the methods and insights could potentially be applied to understanding and supporting people with dyscalculia. The use of deep learning techniques to identify and prioritize clinically relevant features from structured data, as well as the strategies for addressing challenges like imbalanced datasets and data quality issues, could provide a framework for developing predictive models for dyscalculia. Additionally, the interpretability of the DiabetesXpertNet model could offer insights into the underlying factors contributing to dyscalculia, which could inform educational interventions and support for individuals with this condition.",

        "summary": "This study examined the impacts of math anxiety and spatial anxiety on visuo-spatial elements of mathematical performance, specifically number line estimation. Across three experiments, the researchers investigated how different variations of the number line estimation task (directionality, range, and unbounding) interacted with domain-specific anxieties. The results indicated that while directional number line estimation was predicted by math anxiety, no relationship was found for spatial anxiety. The study also explored the relationship between these emotional factors and gender, finding significant differences in anxiety domains but no differences in task performance.",
        "dyscalculia_relevance": "This research provides insights into the role of domain-specific anxieties, particularly math anxiety, in the number-space associations that are often impaired in individuals with dyscalculia. The findings suggest that math anxiety may disrupt the typical spatial organization of numerical representations, which could contribute to the difficulties in numerical and spatial processing commonly observed in dyscalculia. The study's use of varied number line estimation tasks offers a promising approach for further investigating the cognitive mechanisms underlying dyscalculia and exploring potential ways to support individuals with math learning difficulties.",

The study involved 180 students, with the experimental group performing short bouts of physical exercise between classes, while the control group arranged their own physical activity. The researchers monitored various physiological measures, such as body composition, blood pressure, and heart rate variability, as well as mental health indicators like learning burnout and depression levels. The results showed that the intermittent exercise intervention improved the physical health of the experimental group, with lower body fat percentage, blood pressure, and improved cardiovascular fitness. The intervention also had a positive impact on the mental health of the students, reducing learning burnout and depression. The researchers recommend that schools actively incorporate physical exercise breaks during the school day to promote the healthy development of adolescents.",

The improvements in cardiovascular health and reduced risk of chronic diseases observed in this study may also have indirect positive impacts on the overall well-being and learning of students with dyscalculia. Educators and therapists working with students with dyscalculia could consider implementing similar intermittent physical activity interventions as a way to support their students' physical and mental health, which may in turn positively impact their math learning and academic success.",

The researchers recruited 1,436 chronic schizophrenia patients and assessed their psychiatric symptoms, insomnia, suicidal ideation, and cognitive function. They found that patients with insomnia had a significantly higher suicide risk compared to those without. In the insomnia group, the severity of suicidal ideation was negatively correlated with language function scores, and language function and general psychopathology scores were significant predictors of the severity of suicidal ideation as well as suicide risk. The findings suggest that chronic schizophrenia patients with insomnia have a higher risk of suicide, and that language function and general psychopathology serve as risk factors and predictors of suicide risk in this population.",

Key methods included a randomized, placebo-controlled, crossover trial design with active and sham tDCS conditions. The main findings showed that while active tDCS reduced pain perception compared to sham in the off state, there were no significant differences between conditions when dopaminergic medication was administered afterward. This suggests that tDCS may have a direct effect on pain in the off state, but does not provide additional benefits when combined with dopaminergic medication. The practical implication is that tDCS could be a useful non-pharmacological option for managing pain in PD patients during the off state.",
        "dyscalculia_relevance": "This research does not directly investigate dyscalculia or math learning difficulties. However, the findings provide some insights that may be relevant. The study demonstrates that transcranial direct current stimulation can modulate pain perception in Parkinson's disease, a neurological condition that often involves cognitive impairments. While dyscalculia is a distinct condition, it is also characterized by atypical brain functioning and processing. Thus, the neuromodulatory effects of tDCS observed in this study suggest it may be a promising approach for investigating and potentially supporting individuals with dyscalculia and other math learning difficulties, which often co-occur with other neurological or developmental disorders.",

Additionally, the researchers identified structures of tau paired helical filaments and tau straight filaments in the human brain sample that were identical to those found in sporadic Alzheimer's disease. The study provides insights into how specific genetic mutations can influence the structural properties of Aβ and tau aggregates in the Alzheimer's disease brain.",
        "dyscalculia_relevance": "While this research is focused on Alzheimer's disease and does not directly investigate dyscalculia or math learning difficulties, it provides valuable insights into the structural properties of amyloid-β and tau proteins that are implicated in neurodegenerative disorders. The findings suggest that genetic mutations can alter the conformation of these aggregated proteins, which may have implications for understanding the neurobiological basis of cognitive impairments, including those related to numerical and mathematical processing. This knowledge could inform future efforts to develop targeted treatments or support strategies for individuals with dyscalculia or other math learning difficulties.",

        "summary": "This study investigated how the social networks of professional development (PD) providers impact their performance in coaching teachers on implementing evidence-based practices (EBPs) for autistic students. The researchers conducted social network analysis with PD providers and found that having more connections to autism EBP experts and to people who could support them in individualizing PD for specific teachers or districts was associated with higher self-reported performance as teacher coaches. The findings suggest that strengthening the social networks of PD providers could help them overcome barriers to providing high-quality, individualized coaching to teachers on using EBPs for autistic students.",

Like autistic students, students with dyscalculia often have highly individualized learning needs that require teachers to implement specialized, evidence-based instructional practices. The social network factors identified in this study, such as access to content experts and support for tailoring PD, could similarly impact the ability of PD providers to effectively train and coach teachers on using effective, evidence-based math interventions for students with dyscalculia.",

        "summary": "This study examined the changes in psychotic-like experiences (PLEs) over two years in a group of adolescents at high-risk and low-risk for developing severe mental illness (SMI) based on family history. The researchers also investigated whether clinical symptoms (anxiety, depression, anhedonia) and neural reward function predicted the development of PLEs. The results showed that PLEs and associated distress increased over time, with the high-risk group exhibiting a greater rise in PLEs compared to the low-risk group. Heightened right ventral striatum (VS) neural activation and higher anxiety at baseline predicted more PLEs two years later, suggesting that vigilance and sensitivity to external stimuli may be important precursors to the development of PLEs in adolescents.",

Further research is needed to directly explore the connections between these factors in the context of dyscalculia and math learning problems.",

The researchers developed a new model-building framework for neuron-astrocyte networks, introduced connectivity concepts for tripartite neuron-astrocyte interactions, and designed a scalable architecture capable of simulating networks with up to a million cells. The simulation results demonstrate how neuron-astrocyte interactions drive the emergence of synchronization in local neuronal groups, and that by adjusting the strength of neuron-astrocyte interactions, the global activity regime can be switched from asynchronous to network-wide synchronization.",

The models were assessed for their performance in identifying key predictors of depression, such as poor sleep, age, BMI, IADL limitations, socioeconomic status, and lifestyle factors. The random forest model outperformed other approaches, achieving excellent discrimination and calibration. The findings demonstrate the utility of machine learning, particularly interpretable techniques like SHAP, for scalable screening and policy-driven interventions to address the growing burden of geriatric mental health challenges in India.",

Using a 20-year longitudinal dataset of Finnish families, the researchers evaluated 87 young adults who underwent functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) during an emotional go/no-go task. They found that prospective ELS, but not retrospective ELS, was significantly associated with neural representational similarity across 40 cortical regions, including the anterior insula, frontal operculum, and anterior cingulate cortex.

Healthy young adults observed a gray circle that either remained constant or was modified in size at different frequency rates. The results showed a spontaneous increase in alpha power throughout the task, an increase in theta power when the visual stimulus was continuously modified, but no changes when manipulating the frequency of stimulus modification. These findings suggest that the EEG changes observed during NF are influenced by the task environment itself and not only by successful EEG self-modulation. The researchers emphasize the importance of carefully designing NF protocols to account for non-specific effects and ensure that observed EEG changes are due to the hypothesized mechanisms.",

This is an important consideration for the use of neurofeedback in supporting individuals with dyscalculia, as it highlights the need for careful protocol design and interpretation of results to ensure that any observed benefits are directly linked to the targeted brain activity changes.",

        "summary": "This study investigated the challenges disabled resident doctors face in their career progression, the practices that support their careers, and potential solutions applicable to healthcare settings, particularly the UK National Health Service (NHS). The researchers conducted an integrative literature review, analyzing empirical and grey literature to identify persistent structural, cultural, and institutional barriers, such as ableism, inaccessible systems, and stigma around disability disclosure. Key facilitators included mentorship, supportive supervisory relationships, and identity-affirming networks. Promising practices included universal design approaches, proactive accommodations, and integrating disability equity into organizational governance. However, most initiatives remain unevaluated, and UK-specific evidence is limited. The study highlights the need to not only remove barriers to progression for disabled doctors, but also to embed disability inclusion into the structures and cultures shaping medical career paths.",
        "dyscalculia_relevance": "This research on the barriers and facilitators of career progression for disabled doctors provides insights that are relevant to understanding and supporting individuals with dyscalculia, a specific learning difficulty in mathematics. The barriers related to inaccessible systems, stigma, and lack of accommodations may also be experienced by people with dyscalculia in the medical education and training context. The identified facilitators, such as mentorship and supportive relationships, could be applied to help create an environment more conducive to the academic and career success of individuals with dyscalculia. While the study does not focus explicitly on dyscalculia, the insights gained can inform the development of inclusive practices and policies to better support the career progression of medical professionals with math-related learning difficulties.",

The researchers found a significant decline of 6% per year in the proportion of individuals reading for pleasure daily in the US, with widening gaps across population groups based on race, education level, and income. The findings demonstrate the need for more targeted strategies to increase opportunities for reading engagement. Monitoring daily reading patterns and factors influencing reading will be vital to understanding the impact of future policies.",
        "dyscalculia_relevance": "This research provides important insights for understanding reading difficulties, which are often associated with dyscalculia or math learning challenges. The significant declines in reading for pleasure observed across the population, particularly among disadvantaged groups, suggest that access to and engagement with reading may be an important factor in the development of numeracy and broader academic skills. The insights from this study can inform interventions and support strategies to promote reading engagement for individuals with dyscalculia, helping to address the wider literacy challenges they often face.",

        "summary": "This study investigated the incidence of postoperative cognitive dysfunction (POCD) after general or regional anesthesia, as well as potential risk factors. A prospective study was conducted on 90 patients undergoing elective surgery. Patients completed cognitive assessments before and after their procedures. The study found that 42.2% of patients developed POCD the day after surgery. Risk factors included lower education level, previous COVID-19 infection, higher comorbidity index, and general anesthesia, while older age was associated with poorer cognitive performance regardless of anesthesia type. The results suggest that identifying these risk factors before surgery could allow for adjustments to anesthesia and postoperative care to prevent POCD.",
        "dyscalculia_relevance": "This research is relevant to understanding and supporting individuals with dyscalculia, a math learning disability, in a few key ways. First, the cognitive dysfunction observed after surgery, including impairments in orientation, attention, and judgement, could have implications for the mathematical reasoning and problem-solving abilities of people with dyscalculia. Additionally, the finding that older age is associated with poorer cognitive performance is important, as dyscalculia often persists into adulthood. Lastly, the identified risk factors like lower education level and high comorbidity index may also be relevant for individuals with dyscalculia, who often face additional academic and health challenges. Overall, these insights could inform interventions and accommodations to support the math learning and cognitive abilities of people with dyscalculia, especially during major medical events.",

        "summary": "This study investigated whether participation and experiences in organized extracurricular social activities (OESAs) differ for children aged 4-12 years with developmental language disorder (DLD) compared to their typically language developing (TLD) peers. The results showed that parents of children with DLD reported engagement in a similar number of OESAs and for a similar length of time on a weekly basis compared to parents of TLD children. Additionally, when evaluating factors that facilitated positive participation experiences, parents of children with DLD provided ratings mostly comparable to those of TLD parents. However, when children disengaged from an OESA, ability-related factors, such as communication, motor, and social skills, were more likely to be reported to influence the participation experience for children with DLD. These findings underscore the importance of fostering accessible and positive OESA experiences to support meaningful participation and access to the developmental benefits of OESAs for children with DLD.",
        "dyscalculia_relevance": "While this research focuses on children with developmental language disorder (DLD) rather than dyscalculia, it provides valuable insights that may be applicable to understanding the participation and experiences of children with dyscalculia or other math learning difficulties in extracurricular activities. The study highlights the importance of ensuring that extracurricular programs are accessible and supportive for children with developmental disabilities, allowing them to engage in meaningful social activities and access the associated developmental benefits. The findings suggest that ability-related factors, such as communication, motor, and social skills, can influence the participation experiences of children with developmental disorders, which may be relevant for children with dyscalculia as well. This research underscores the need for targeted support strategies, such as facilitating beginner-friendly entry points and fostering inclusive peer environments, to optimize the participation of children with dyscalculia in extracurricular activities.",

The NSSI group exhibited significantly higher scores on self-report measures of non-suicidal self-injury and suicidal ideation. fNIRS results showed reduced prefrontal and temporal lobe activation in the NSSI group, while TMS-EEG analysis indicated heightened P30 amplitudes in the left and right prefrontal cortex in the NSSI group. The findings suggest that adolescents with NSSI exhibit abnormal cortical excitability, particularly in the prefrontal regions, which may contribute to impulsive behaviors and cognitive control difficulties. This study highlights the potential of combining TMS-EEG and fNIRS to explore the neurophysiological substrates of NSSI, providing preliminary evidence that may guide future research on diagnostic and therapeutic strategies.",
        "dyscalculia_relevance": "While this research does not directly address dyscalculia or math learning difficulties, the observed abnormalities in prefrontal cortex function and impulsivity in adolescents with non-suicidal self-injury (NSSI) may provide insights relevant to understanding dyscalculia. The prefrontal cortex plays a crucial role in cognitive control, decision-making, and emotion regulation, which are often impaired in individuals with dyscalculia. The findings from this study suggest that examining cortical excitability and functional brain activity using techniques like TMS-EEG and fNIRS could help elucidate the neurophysiological mechanisms underlying dyscalculia and inform the development of targeted interventions for individuals with math learning difficulties.",

The study focused on children with comorbid reading comprehension and word-problem solving difficulties, which is a common profile seen in dyscalculia. The findings indicate that targeted text-structure interventions can not only improve performance in the trained domain, but also lead to gains in the untrained domain. This suggests that addressing the underlying language and text comprehension skills may be a promising approach for helping students with dyscalculia, who often struggle with word-problem solving.

The researchers conducted cognitive assessments, functional MRI tasks, structural diffusion-weighted imaging, and T1-weighted imaging on 19 dyslexic and 19 control subjects. They found that dyslexic individuals performed worse on phonological tasks and showed reduced cerebellar responses to rhythmic stimuli, as well as structural disorganization in white matter tracts and cortical regions. Importantly, a machine learning model trained on features from all three MRI modalities could discriminate between dyslexic and control participants with greater accuracy than single-modality models. The individual classification scores from the multimodal model correlated with behavioral reading accuracy, suggesting that dyslexia is a complex condition with multiple distinctive cognitive and brain traits.",
        "dyscalculia_relevance": "While this study focused on dyslexia, the multimodal approach used to investigate the neurocognitive deficits underlying the disorder could also be informative for understanding dyscalculia or math learning difficulties. Like dyslexia, dyscalculia is a complex condition that likely involves a combination of cognitive and neural impairments. The finding that a machine learning model integrating structural and functional MRI data could better discriminate between dyslexic and control individuals suggests that a similar multimodal approach may be useful for identifying the distinct neural and cognitive profiles associated with dyscalculia. Additionally, the study's exploration of deficits in phonological processing, motion perception, and implicit learning could provide insights into the cognitive mechanisms that contribute to both reading and math difficulties.",

The results showed that eating attitudes partially mediated the link between social media use and well-being, and orthorexia nervosa moderated this mediating effect, with the moderation being stronger among individuals with low levels of orthorexia nervosa. The study suggests that eating attitudes are a key mechanism linking social media use and well-being, and this pathway is influenced by individual differences in orthorexia nervosa tendencies. These findings can aid in the development of interventions for eating disorders and guide individuals towards healthier lifestyles.",
        "dyscalculia_relevance": "While this study does not directly examine dyscalculia or math learning difficulties, the insights it provides into the relationship between social media use, eating attitudes, and well-being may have indirect relevance for understanding some of the challenges faced by individuals with dyscalculia. Individuals with dyscalculia often experience challenges in various areas of life, including social-emotional functioning, which can be influenced by factors such as social media use and disordered eating patterns. The moderated mediation model explored in this study could inform future research on how digital experiences and maladaptive eating behaviors may interact to impact the well-being of individuals with dyscalculia or other math learning difficulties.",

        "summary": "This study investigates how academic stress is semantically constructed and expressed by learners in digital environments. Using a multilayered topic modeling framework, the researchers analyzed over 33,000 user comments related to academic pressure on social media. Grounded in Multilevel Stress Theory, the analysis identified six interconnected topics reflecting individual, situational, and structural stressors. The researchers then developed the Expectancy-Regulation-Amplification (ERA) Model, which conceptualizes academic stress as a dynamic process shaped by the tension between external expectations and perceived capabilities, limitations in self-regulatory resources, and the cumulative amplification of stress across sociocultural and digital contexts. The ERA model provides a framework for understanding the semantics of student vulnerability and offers insights for targeted interventions in educational and mental health contexts.",
        "dyscalculia_relevance": "While this study does not directly examine dyscalculia or math learning difficulties, the insights it provides into the multidimensional nature of academic stress and the role of digital environments in amplifying stress could be highly relevant. The ERA model's focus on the interplay between individual, situational, and structural factors in shaping academic stress may offer useful perspectives for understanding the unique challenges faced by students with dyscalculia. Additionally, the semantic analysis of how academic stress is linguistically expressed could inform the development of more nuanced support strategies for students with math learning difficulties, who may experience heightened stress and vulnerability within educational systems.",

The model replaces standard convolution modules with the ECDF module, which combines deep separable convolution and attention mechanisms. This significantly reduces the number of parameters and computational complexity while improving segmentation performance. Experimental results show that LMSAUnet outperforms state-of-the-art segmentation models on multiple skin lesion datasets, demonstrating its potential for efficient and accurate skin lesion segmentation in resource-constrained clinical environments.",
        "dyscalculia_relevance": "While this research is focused on skin lesion segmentation and not directly related to dyscalculia or math learning difficulties, the development of efficient and accurate segmentation models could have potential applications for people with dyscalculia. For example, if a person with dyscalculia has a skin condition that requires regular monitoring and analysis of skin lesions, a lightweight model like LMSAUnet could be used to provide accurate and timely assessments without requiring significant computing resources. This could improve access to diagnostic tools and support for people with dyscalculia who may also have associated skin conditions.",

The researchers developed a laboratory testbed to examine the feasibility of the ISAR approach, including a custom antenna and the use of water as a matching medium. They tested the forward and inverse models in simulated and physical environments using biological specimens, aiming to localize internal anomalies with sub-centimeter resolution. The reconstructed images from vegetable phantoms suggest the technique may be capable of detecting internal structural variations, providing a foundation for future investigations into human brain imaging applications.",

Using a comprehensive neuropsychological assessment, the researchers found that individuals with histories of childhood maltreatment performed worse on all cognitive tests and had significantly higher risk for cognitive impairment with no dementia, including both amnestic and non-amnestic types. The findings suggest that the cognitive repercussions of childhood maltreatment continue into late midlife, reinforcing the importance of early detection and preventive interventions to mitigate the long-term risks associated with childhood adversity.",
        "dyscalculia_relevance": "This research is relevant to understanding dyscalculia and math learning difficulties in several ways. First, the study found that childhood maltreatment was associated with deficits across a broad range of cognitive abilities, including areas like attention, visuospatial skills, and language that are important for mathematical thinking and learning. This suggests that early adversity and trauma can disrupt the neurodevelopmental processes underlying the acquisition of mathematical skills. Additionally, the finding that maltreatment increased the risk of both amnestic and non-amnestic forms of cognitive impairment provides insights into the diverse ways that childhood adversity may impact math learning and performance, potentially affecting memory, processing speed, and other key cognitive domains.

The researchers used magnetic resonance imaging techniques to measure these parameters and assess their association with clinical and radiological disease measures. The results showed that patients had larger frontal and parietal PSD volumes, as well as larger parietal AG volumes, compared to healthy controls. Parietal PSD volume was also found to correlate with chronic black hole macromolecular content.

The researchers analyzed data from the SeFallED study conducted in Germany. They established 28 major diagnostic groups and used Cohen's Kappa to assess the agreement between self-reported and GP-reported diagnoses. Logistic regression was used to identify associations between population characteristics (e.g., cognition, concerns about falling, age) and discordance between self-reported and GP-reported diagnoses. The study found poor overall agreement between self-reported and GP-reported diagnoses, with age, sex, BMI, cognition, concerns about falling, education, and living arrangements associated with discordance. Participants were more likely to report diseases with more noticeable symptoms and frequent monitoring, such as Parkinson's disease or diabetes mellitus.

        "summary": "This study aimed to develop a multidimensional health indicator system for college students in China. The researchers conducted a literature review, brainstorming, and focus group discussions to construct an initial version of the indicator system. They then used the Delphi method to consult with 21 experts and confirm the weights of the indicator system. A survey of 366 college students was also conducted to validate the indicator system. The final system included 6 dimensions and 60 items covering physical health, mental health, lifestyle, environmental health, moral health, and vocational ability. The researchers found the indicator system to be scientifically sound and reliable, and it can be used to comprehensively evaluate the health status of college students. This can help students understand their own health and provide a basis for colleges and universities to improve students' health management.",
        "dyscalculia_relevance": "While this research does not directly focus on dyscalculia or math learning difficulties, the multidimensional health indicator system it develops could provide insights relevant to supporting students with these challenges. The inclusion of dimensions like mental health, lifestyle, and vocational ability may offer useful information for understanding the broader well-being and functioning of students with dyscalculia. Educators and therapists working with this population could potentially apply aspects of the indicator system to better assess the holistic health needs of these students and inform tailored interventions.",

The researchers conducted a survey with 3,386 pregnant women, assessing their depressive symptoms, family functioning, and stressful life events. Structural equation modeling was used to analyze the data. The findings revealed that family functioning partially mediated the relationship between stressful life events and depressive symptoms, explaining 21.9% of the variance. The study suggests that improving family functioning and fostering communication can help reduce depressive symptoms during the second trimester, supporting maternal mental health.",

        "summary": "This study investigated the role of amyloid-beta (Aβ) in modulating synaptic plasticity and sensory processing in the spinal dorsal horn. The researchers used ELISA, von Frey testing, and immunohistochemistry to assess the effects of intrathecally delivered synthetic Aβ in a mouse model of neuropathic pain induced by spared nerve injury (SNI). They found that Aβ temporarily improved mechanical sensitivity in female mice, and delivering Aβ via a hydrogel significantly decreased mechanical sensitivity for up to 10 days post-SNI in both sexes. Additionally, the hydrogel delivery of Aβ led to changes in microglia morphology in the spinal dorsal horn of female mice. The results suggest that modulating Aβ levels may play a role in regulating mechanical sensitivity in neuropathic pain.",

        "summary": "This study developed a computational model using Fuzzy Cognitive Maps (FCMs) to simulate and predict individual pain experiences based on expert input across multiple disciplines, including neurology, pain management, psychology, sociology, and genetics. The FCM model integrated six key concepts that influence pain perception: the brain and neural basis of pain, psychological factors, social factors, individual differences, type of tissue damage, and general pain perception. The model demonstrated strong reinforcing influences between psychological and neural factors, while social influences tended to inhibit perceived pain. Centrality analysis highlighted individual differences as a critical mediating node in the system. The researchers validated the model through expert consensus and scenario-based simulations, with plans for future empirical validation using standardized psychological instruments.",

The researchers used a data-driven subtyping approach (mixture model analysis) on a sample of 1,015 children, 93 of whom were identified as dyscalculic. The analysis included measures of mathematical skills, working memory, reading fluency, and intelligence. The results suggest that dyscalculia subtypes (as well as children with dyscalculia in general) are not clearly distinguishable from children without dyscalculia, and that the boundaries are fluid. The authors conclude that all children with difficulties in mathematics should be supported, not just those classified as dyscalculic.",
        "dyscalculia_relevance": "This research provides important insights into the heterogeneous nature of dyscalculia. The findings indicate that children with dyscalculia do not form a clearly distinct group, but rather exist on a continuum with children without diagnosed dyscalculia. This has practical implications for educators, as it suggests that support and intervention for math difficulties should be provided to all struggling students, not just those formally diagnosed with dyscalculia. The insights from this study can help inform a more inclusive and comprehensive approach to supporting individuals with math learning difficulties.",

The study collected 585 responses from university students who are users of metaverse applications and analyzed the data using Partial Least Squares Structural Equation Modeling. The findings reveal that the time spent in the metaverse and the interactivity of the virtual environments contribute to students' attachment to the metaverse as an alternative reality.

The review included 12 studies with 671 participants, examining the use of manual acupuncture, electroacupuncture, or a combination. The neuroimaging tools used were functional magnetic resonance imaging, electroencephalography, magnetic resonance spectroscopy, and functional near-infrared spectroscopy. The findings consistently showed positive effects of acupuncture on PSCI, with changes in brain structure and function observed in regions like the cingulate cortex, parahippocampal gyrus, prefrontal cortex, and fusiform gyrus. Acupuncture appears to modulate cognition-related brain networks, including the default mode, central executive, frontoparietal, and salience networks, thereby influencing PSCI. However, further research using multiple imaging techniques and large, well-designed multicenter trials is needed to validate these neuroimaging findings.",

Rough numbers were used to represent the linguistic and uncertain judgments of patients and experts, while the rough BWM determined robust criteria weights and the rough GLDS ranked hospital alternatives by considering both overall and criterion-level performance. The proposed method was validated through a case study of five hospitals in Jinan, China, confirming that the framework produces reliable and interpretable rankings, identifies the best-performing institution, and demonstrates robustness under sensitivity analysis.

Healthy young adults completed an IH protocol and a normoxic control protocol, and their EF was assessed using the antisaccade task before, immediately after, and 30 minutes after each protocol. The results showed that the hypoxic intervals led to decreased oxygen saturation and increased cerebral blood flow, but did not immediately impact EF. However, 30 minutes after the IH protocol, the participants showed improved antisaccade reaction times, indicating a delayed EF benefit. This suggests that a single bout of IH can provide a transient boost to EF, likely through physiological changes that enhance neural processing, rather than being directly linked to the changes in cerebral blood flow during the hypoxic intervals.",

        "summary": "This study investigates the use of newly developed smartphone-based and gamified Adaptive Cognitive Assessments (ACAs) to improve the responsiveness of cognitive endpoints in clinical studies of Alzheimer's and other neurodegenerative diseases. The researchers conducted simulations to compare two ACA paradigms: one with a fixed difficulty level and one with an adaptive difficulty level. The results show that the adaptive difficulty paradigm outperformed the fixed-difficulty paradigm in terms of responsiveness, especially for cognitive decline rates greater than 2.5% per year. The researchers conclude that ACA deployment should be guided by study and assessment features, and that simulations are essential to identify suitable strategies in the complex parameter space of ACA instruments.",
        "dyscalculia_relevance": "While this research focuses on Alzheimer's and other neurodegenerative diseases, the findings may also be relevant for understanding and supporting people with dyscalculia or other math learning difficulties. The use of adaptive cognitive assessments could provide valuable insights into the cognitive profiles and trajectories of individuals with dyscalculia, as well as help to develop more sensitive and responsive tools for identifying and monitoring their strengths and weaknesses. Additionally, the principles of adaptive testing and gamification explored in this study could inform the design of educational interventions and assessments tailored to the needs of people with dyscalculia.",

The researchers measured levels and deletions of circulating cell-free mtDNA (ccf-mtDNA) as well as inflammatory markers (interleukins 1λ, 5, and 6) in older adults with LLD and healthy controls. The results showed that LLD was associated with increased ccf-mtDNA instability, which was linked to more severe depressive symptoms and greater medical comorbidities. Longitudinal analysis revealed that higher ccf-mtDNA deletion rates at baseline predicted elevated levels of certain inflammatory markers at 30-month follow-up. These findings suggest that decreased mtDNA integrity may contribute to emotional dysregulation and medical burden in LLD through heightened inflammation.",

The researchers created 'The Moving Mandala', a playful mixed reality experience designed to foster real-time synchrony among groups of children through audiovisual cues and embodied interaction. The study tested whether rhythmic auditory stimuli improved synchrony performance compared to non-rhythmic ambient sound, and whether synchronous movements facilitated prosocial behavior and social bonding compared to asynchronous and no prior movements. The results showed that rhythmic music significantly improved synchrony performance, but no significant differences in prosocial behavior or social bonding were found between the conditions. The researchers suggest that design choices such as limited mutual dependency and high cognitive load may have reduced the salience of interpersonal cues, highlighting both the potential and challenges of using mixed reality to promote synchrony-based social outcomes.",

Additionally, the study's consideration of socio-demographic variables, such as education level, provides insights into how environmental and experiential factors can shape both math skills and mental health. These insights can inform the development of tailored interventions and support for older adults with dyscalculia, ensuring a comprehensive approach that addresses both cognitive and psychological needs.",

        "summary": "This study evaluated the metabolic and psychosocial effects of gender-affirming hormone therapy (GAHT) in a cohort of transgender individuals. The researchers followed 18 transgender women and 3 transgender men over 6 months, assessing changes in parameters like blood glucose, lipid profile, body composition, and psychosocial well-being. They found that transgender women exhibited more pronounced metabolic changes, with significant increases in fasting blood sugar, HbA1c, cholesterol, and waist circumference. However, both groups showed substantial improvements in gender congruence and life satisfaction scores. The findings underscore the importance of integrated care models that balance gender-affirming goals with monitoring of cardiometabolic risk in transgender individuals.",
        "dyscalculia_relevance": "This study does not directly investigate dyscalculia or math learning difficulties. However, the metabolic changes observed, particularly the increases in blood glucose and HbA1c levels, could have implications for cognitive function and academic performance in transgender individuals receiving GAHT. Further research is needed to understand any potential links between GAHT, metabolic dysregulation, and difficulties with numerical processing or mathematics.",

Using a range of techniques including behavioral phenotyping, multimodal MRI, in vivo calcium imaging, and brain-wide genomics, the researchers examined changes in brain structure, functional connectivity, neural activity, and gene expression. They observed a reduction in gray matter volume, particularly in the prefrontal cortex, along with disruptions to multi-scale functional connectivity and alterations in the macro-organizational functional gradient. Neural activity in the medial prefrontal cortex demonstrated exposure-time-dependent changes across emotional tasks, while genetic analyses linked the observed changes to synaptic function and ion channel activity. These findings provide insights into how extreme environments can impact emotional behaviors, brain networks, and neural activity, which can inform interventions to maintain brain integrity during extended space missions.",

The researchers used the combined compromise solution (CoCoSo) method in an interval-valued spherical fuzzy (IVSF) framework to evaluate ten generative AI platforms based on criteria like creativity, cost, and customization. The IVSF framework allowed the researchers to capture the uncertainty and varying expert opinions in this creative domain. The study found that the DeepArt platform is the most suitable generative AI tool, as it achieves high creativity, output quality, and customization.

The study included 10 prelocutive deaf children and 10 normally hearing children. The results showed that both groups had similar magnitude and distance effects on the tasks, but the deaf group had slower response times on the symbolic task alone.

Using an addition verification task, the researchers manipulated the distance between the proposed and correct answers to see how participants responded. The TA groups were sensitive to answer plausibility on simple problems, faster at rejecting extremely incorrect results than accepting correct answers on complex problems, and showed a reduced complexity effect for implausible problems, indicating the use of approximate calculation. In contrast, children with MD were unaffected by answer plausibility on simple problems, processed implausible and correct sums equally on complex problems, and exhibited a smaller reduction in the complexity effect for implausible problems. They also made more errors on implausible problems. The findings suggest children with MD have deficits in using approximate calculation strategies adaptively.",

The study found that for children with MD, posttest outcomes on standardized measures improved significantly under the verbal + visual strategies condition, whereas posttest scores on the experimental problem-solving measures improved under the materials-only condition.

The researchers compared the performance of 45 children with MD and 45 normally achieving peers on tasks assessing symbolic (Arabic digits) and non-symbolic (collections) number magnitude processing. The findings suggest that children with MD have difficulty accessing number magnitude from symbols rather than in processing numerosity per se.

Additionally, they automatically processed number magnitude when comparing the physical size of Arabic digits, indicating an intact sense of number magnitude.

It contrasted predictions from the analog numerical model and the object-file model by testing the effects of size and ratio between numerosities to be compared. The study also evaluated the hypothesis that comparison by preschoolers is based on correlated perceptual variables rather than on number per se. The results showed no evidence that preschoolers use an analog number magnitude or an object-file mechanism to compare numerosities. Instead, their inability to compare sets controlled for surface area suggests they rely on perceptual cues. Furthermore, the development of numerosity-based representations seems to be related to some understanding of the cardinality concept.",
