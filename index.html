            <h2>Building Solutions Together for Dyscalculia</h2>
            <p>Dyscalculia affects 3-7% of students - as common as dyslexia - yet it's rarely recognized or understood. Many bright kids struggle with math basics while their needs go unmet because teachers and parents don't know what dyscalculia looks like.</p>
            <p><strong>The challenge:</strong> Unlike dyslexia, dyscalculia lacks awareness, research funding, and proven interventions. Students often feel "bad at math" when they actually have a learning difference that can be supported.</p>
            <p><strong>Join our growing community:</strong> Whether you're discovering strategies in your classroom, researching new approaches, or supporting a child at home - your experience matters in changing this.</p>
            <p><strong>Together we can:</strong> Raise awareness, share proven techniques, and build the resources that students with dyscalculia truly deserve.</p>
            <p><em>Every insight shared helps another student succeed and brings dyscalculia out of the shadows.</em></p>
